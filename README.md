This is a trivia app in which the user can choose a difficulty and category, or completely randomize it and try their best at answering the questions within a certain amount of time. The postgame page will display the questions and answers and highlight the ones you got correctly in green and incorrectly in red. Currently, a working login and signup page are in progress as well as a scoreboard so users can save their information and look at their updated scores anytime they want to login. All the user needs to do is choose their difficulty, subject, and amount of questions and hit play. This was built as a react app using react and Material UI as well as a trivia API and cockroach.
